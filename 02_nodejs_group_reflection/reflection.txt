1. Your Role:

Developer

Being a developer in a team is difficult, especially for me that has little experience in following conventional/efficient programming. I had problems with setting up my local environment, as well as forgetting to pull from the remote repository every time I do my task.
I'm also having a hard time doing front end as it focuses on the design of the website, the feel of the website. I also had difficulties in with the file structures and modularization of the codes too, as I am new to it.

2. Teamwork Experience:

It is good.

Our Project managers are strict with the schedule, but are understanding when we developers face difficulties and even offered help if we needed.


Our team faced some difficulties with a few members as they only attended meetings a few times and rarely complied with the tasks they're given. But that has been taken care of.

all in all, I think that my team's coordination is good!

3. Personal Growth and Discipline:

I want to start learning about back end development, it might be my forte or at least I be better than my front-end developing skills.
 
As for debugging, I kind of enjoy debugging especially when you solve the problem without creating another problem, it feels good.

I'd also want to improve on modularizing my code as it's daunting to read a thousand line code and it's clean and I can reuse the function.
