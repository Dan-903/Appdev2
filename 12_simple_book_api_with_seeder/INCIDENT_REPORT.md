Dear [Instructor Name],

I am writing to formally explain the circumstances that led to the late submission of Activity #12 (Adding Data Seeding with Faker.js). I sincerely apologize for not meeting the original deadline and would like to provide a detailed explanation of the situation.

## Reason for Late Submission

I was occupied all week with debugging ISPM/AppDev Project and barely had any time to do any other activities. I sincerely apologize for not meeting the original deadline.
