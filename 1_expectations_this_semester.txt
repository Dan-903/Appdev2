1. Introduction

I have used languages like "Java", "Python", "Javascript", "PHP". And have explore other stuff like using MySQL. I have little to no experience with backend
but I'm hoping that I find this easier than frontend development since I take too long and struggle with frontend. 

2. Course Expectation

I want to hone my skills as a developer during this course

I want to learn how APIs work and function in systems, I would also want to learn how to use these frameworks mentioned. And also God-Willing,
learn how to manage a database.

Since I find front-end development a struggle to work on, I'm hoping that at least I could be good at back-end development. Maybe back-end development will be the career that I'm looking for.

3. Challenges and Areas for Improvement

Front-end development is something that I want to improve on eventually, I find design bothersome. I think I just have to keep on practicing, eventually I'll get better at it
as I get more familiar with the tools and languages I'm using.

4. Expectations from the Instructor

As the instructor, I expect a patient and understanding teacher when it comes to us learning and developing our skills. And I would also like to have tutorials and coding examples that can guide me
in this course.

5. Final Thoughts

I learn best when I study at my own pace, learning in class is sometimes a hit or miss because of the pacing of the lessons. 
And there's only so much information I can retain in a day considering we have a lot of subjects to attend to.
